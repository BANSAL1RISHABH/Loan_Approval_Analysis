# Home Loan Approval Dataset Analysis

This project focuses on conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a home loan approval dataset sourced from Skill Circle. The primary goals include gaining familiarity with the dataset, performing data exploration and visualization, identifying patterns, trends, and potential insights, and generating meaningful visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

## Dataset Information
- **Dataset**: Home Loan Approval Dataset
- **Source**: Skill Circle

## Project Tasks
### Task 1: Data Exploration
- Load the dataset into a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).
- Display the initial rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
- Check for missing values and handle them if necessary.
- Summarize basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for the numeric columns.

### Task 2: Data Visualization
#### 2.1 Univariate Analysis
- Explore the distribution of numeric columns using histograms and box plots.
- Analyze categorical variables with bar charts and pie charts.

#### 2.2 Bivariate Analysis
- Create scatter plots to explore relationships between numeric variables.
- Use pair plots to visualize interactions between multiple numeric variables.
- Investigate relationships between categorical and numeric variables using box plots or violin plots.

#### 2.3 Multivariate Analysis
- Perform correlation analysis to identify relationships between numeric variables and visualize them using a heatmap.
- Create a stacked bar chart to show the distribution of categorical variables across multiple categories.

This project demonstrates proficiency in data exploration, visualization, and analysis techniques, showcasing the ability to derive insights from complex datasets and effectively communicate findings through visual representations.
