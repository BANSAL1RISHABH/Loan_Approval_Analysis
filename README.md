# Loan_Approval_Analysis

The project involved conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a home loan approval dataset sourced from Skill Circle. The main objectives were to gain familiarity with the dataset, perform data exploration and visualization, identify patterns, trends, and potential insights, and generate meaningful visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
Project Synopsis:
Dataset Information: The dataset, named "Home Loan Approval Dataset," was accessed and downloaded from Google Drive online.
Project Tasks:
Task 1: Data Exploration:
Loaded the dataset into a Python environment, specifically Jupyter Notebook.
Displayed the initial rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
Checked for missing values and handled them if necessary.
Summarized basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for the numeric columns.
Task 2: Data Visualization:
Conducted univariate analysis by exploring the distribution of numeric columns using histograms and box plots.
Analyzed categorical variables through bar charts and pie charts.
Performed bivariate analysis using scatter plots, pair plots, and box plots/violin plots to investigate relationships between variables.
Carried out multivariate analysis by performing correlation analysis and visualizing correlations using a heatmap. Created a stacked bar chart to show the distribution of categorical variables across multiple categories.
Task 4: Geospatial Analysis (Optional):
Visualized data on a map to identify regional trends if the dataset contained geographical information. Used scatter plots or heatmaps to display data patterns across geographic locations.
